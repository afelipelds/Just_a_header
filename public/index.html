        <h1>Lions on ice: the 'old engineering trick' used to place sculptures in front of Masonic library</h1>
        <p>
            Visitors to the Iowa Masonic Library and Museums at 813 First Ave. SE walk between two large marble lions as
            they enter the building that houses one of the largest Masonic libraries in the world. The
            15,642-square-foot library has a collection of more than 150,000 books as well as thousands of artifacts.
            The first Masonic Library in Iowa was built in Cedar Rapids due to generous donations and the foresight of
            teacher, lawyer, judge, state officer and library collector Theodore Sutton Parvin.
            This April 22, 1955, Gazette clipping shows Arnold Larson with one of the 3,000-pound Vermont marble lions
            that were to be put outside the entrance of the new Iowa Masonic Library and Museums at 813 First Ave. SE in
            Cedar Rapids. Larson, the general construction superintendent, used “an old engineering trick” to maneuver
            the lions into place.

            Parvin became Iowa’s first state librarian in 1838 when territorial Gov. Robert Lucas handed him $5,000 and
            sent him back East to buy books for a territorial library. From then on, Parvin was a collector of books,
            art and curiosities from around the world.
            <br><br>
            When Parvin, a Mason, came to Cedar Rapids, he started the Masonic library in his home. It became apparent a
            building was needed. Most people thought it would be in Des Moines, but Cedar Rapids offered $10,000 and a
            lot along First Avenue. The Masons built a $32,000 fireproof library — of brick, stone and iron — that
            opened in 1884.
            This Gazette clipping shows contractor Ted Paulson checking on the melting of ice blocks used when two
            marble lions were set in place at the entrance to the Iowa Masonic Library and Museums. The library was
            dedicated on June 14, 1955.

            The library’s collection grew in scope and value, requiring an addition in 1913.
            <br>
            Among the library’s growing collection was the framed print of the largest photograph in the world. It was
            taken by George R. Lawrence in 1905 with a huge cherry wood camera he built to photograph a train for the
            Chicago and Alton Railway. The single plate was 4-1/2-by-8 feet.

            In 1921, Grant Wood was commissioned to paint a three-panel canvas of “The First Three Degrees of
            Freemasonry.” The artist became a Mason at Mount Hermon Lodge No. 263 that year.

            In 1946, lodge members felt their building was too cramped and began saving funds for a new library.

            <b>THE NEW Iowa Masonic library</b> <br><br>
            This June 1955 photo shows the front entrance to the new Iowa Masonic Library and Museums in Cedar Rapids,
            with the lions in place and a 1952 Chevrolet parked in front. At left, note the sign for O.F. Paulson,
            general contractor of the building. (Gazette archives)
            In 1951, Lena Hodgin transferred her house at 827 First Ave. SE to the Masons, who combined it with the
            adjacent property as the site for the new library.

            In 1953, the lodge decided to raze the house and its lodge, library, and addition to create enough space for
            the library’s 62,000 volumes and collections.
            <br><br>

            Cedar Rapids issued a building permit in July 1953 for the new L-shaped library designed by Mason City
            architects Hansen & Waggoner. O.F. Paulson Co. was general contractor.
            In 1953, the original Iowa Masonic Library in Cedar Rapids, built in 1884, falls to the wrecking ball. The
            library addition in the background, built in 1913, would remain standing until the new Iowa Masonic Library
            and Museums opened in 1955. (Gazette archives)

            More than 500 people witnessed the laying of the cornerstone on Oct. 10, 1953.
            <br><br>
            In March 1955, workers began transferring 36 truckloads of books and artifacts into the new, $1 million
            white marble building.
            placing the lions in front of the Iowa Masonic Library

            The exterior was finished with the exception of the two marble lions that were to sit on either side of the
            library’s First Avenue entrance.
            This 1915 photograph shows the original Iowa Masonic Library and its 1913 addition at the rear. The
            buildings and the house at the far right were demolished in 1953 to make way for a new marble library that
            was finished in 1955. After library materials were transferred from the addition, it, too, was razed. (Iowa
            Masonic Library and Museums)

            The crated lions, which arrived in April from Proctor, Vt., presented a peculiar problem for the
            construction superintendent, Arnold Larson. Each lion weighed 3,000 pounds, so setting them on their
            pedestals was going to take some engineering.

            “There’s no way to pick them up except by slings,” Larson said at the time. “We have the problem of getting
            the slings out and still have the giant heads in exactly the right spot. Once they’re in place, there’s no
            jockeying them around as you might get a piece of metal.”
            <br><br>
            Larson opted to use an “old engineering trick” involving ice.
            <br>
            Eight 20-pound blocks of ice were placed at the eight corners of the lion’s pedestals. The lions were
            lowered onto the ice, and the slings removed. Water from hoses was sprayed on the ice to hurry its melting,
            while engineers maneuvered the lions into place.
            <br>
            It worked, and the lions haven’t moved in the past 64 years.
            More than half of the original Iowa Masonic Library built in 1884 was demolished by the time this 1953 photo
            was taken. The 1913 library addition at the rear remained standing until the new Iowa Masonic Library opened
            in 1955. (Gazette archives)
            <br>
            One of the Paulson officials said the ice solution “is one of the older tricks of the business. I saw it
            explained in an engineering textbook that was published in 1913.”
            <br>
            A groan worthy PUN

            When the new Iowa Masonic Library and Museums was dedicated on June 14, 1955, The Gazette’s city editor (and
            later managing editor) Jack Illian quipped that anyone looking at the huge statues would have to conclude,
            “There’s a lot of reading between the lions.”
